# AI-Powered Legal Guidance
Welcome to AI-Powered Legal Guidance, a platform that provides general legal information and guidance related to Philippine law using artificial intelligence.

## About the Project
This project aims to assist individuals who have legal questions and concerns related to Philippine law. With the use of artificial intelligence, we provide general legal information and guidance related to various areas of law, including Employment Law, Property Law, and more.

## Getting Started
To use the platform, simply input your legal question and select the specific area of law that your question pertains to from the dropdown menu. You will then receive general legal information and guidance related to your legal issue.

Please note that the legal information we provide is not a substitute for legal advice from a licensed attorney. If you require legal advice, we can assist you in finding a licensed attorney who can provide you with the legal advice you need.
